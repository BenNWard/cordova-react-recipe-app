# Cordova-React Integration Example

This project demonstrates how to integrate a hosted React application into a Cordova project for both iOS and Android.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your development machine.
- A basic understanding of React and Cordova.
- Android Emulator or a physical Android device for Android testing.
- Xcode and iOS Simulator or a physical iOS device for iOS testing.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Step 1 - Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-cordova-react-app.git
cd your-cordova-react-app
```

### Step 2 - Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3 - Verify Cordova Installation

Verify that Cordova is installed and configured correctly:

```bash
cordova --version
```

### Step 4 - Add Cordova Platforms

Add the iOS and Android platforms to your Cordova project:

```bash
npm run setup
```

### Step 5 - Modify Configuration

Update your Cordova `config.xml` file with the necessary preferences and permissions:

```xml
<content src="http://<your domain here>:3000" />
```
or for local dev :
```xml
<content src="http://<IPv4 Address of local react server here>:3000" />
```

### Step 6 - Start the React App

Start your React app in the project root directory:

```bash
yarn start
```

### Step 7 - Run Cordova on iOS and Android

In a separate terminal, navigate to the `cordova` directory and run Cordova on iOS and Android:

```bash
cd cordova
npm run run:ios
npm run run:android
```

## Available Scripts

In the `cordova` directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm run run:android`: Run the Cordova app on Android.
- `npm run run:ios`: Run the Cordova app on iOS in debug mode.
- `npm run setup:android`: Add the Android platform to Cordova.
- `npm run setup:ios`: Add the iOS platform to Cordova.
